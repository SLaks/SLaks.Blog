<p>When working with large .Net applications, it can be useful to find out where event handlers are being registered, especially in an unfamiliar codebase.</p>  <p>In simple cases, you can do this by right-clicking the event definition and clicking Find All References (Shift+F12).&#160; This will show you every line of code that adds or removes a handler from the event by name.&#160; For field-like (ordinary) events, this will also show you every line of code that raises the event.</p>  <p>However, this isn’t always good enough.&#160; Sometimes, event handlers are not added by name.&#160; The .Net data-binding infrastructure, as well as the CompositeUI <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650653.aspx">Event Broker service</a>, will add and remove event handlers using reflection, so they won’t be found by Find All References.&#160; Similarly, if an event handler is added by an external DLL, Find All References won’t find it.</p>  <p>For these scenarios, you can use a less-obvious trick.&#160; As I described <a href="/2011/07/about-net-events.html">last time</a>, adding or removing an event handler actually executes code inside of an accessor method. Like any other code, we can set a breakpoint to see where the code is executed. </p>  <p>For custom events, this is easy.&#160; Just add a breakpoint in the <code>add</code> and/or <code>remove</code> accessors and run your program.&#160; Whenever a handler is added or removed, the debugger will break into the accessor, and you can look at the callstack to determine where it’s coming from.</p>  <p>However, most events are field-like, and don’t have actual source code in their accessor methods.&#160; To set a breakpoint in a field-like event, you need to use a lesser-known feature: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15d1wtaf.aspx">function breakpoints</a> (Unfortunately, this feature is not available in Visual Studio Express).&#160; You can click Debug, New Breakpoint, Break at Function (Ctrl+D, N) to tell the debugger to pause whenever a specific managed function is executed.</p>  <p>To add a breakpoint at an event accessor, type <code>Namespace.ClassName.add_EventName</code>.&#160; To ensure that you entered it correctly, open the Debug, Breakpoints window (Ctrl+D, B) and check that the new breakpoint says <strong>break always (currently 0)</strong> in the Hit Count column.&#160; If it doesn’t say <strong>(currently 0)</strong>, then either the assembly has not been loaded yet or you made a typo in the location (right-click the breakpoint and click Location).</p>
