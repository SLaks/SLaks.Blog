<p>Until now, I've been focusing on only one of the differences between delegates and function pointers; namely, associated state.    <br />Delegates have one other capability that function pointers do not.&#160; A single function pointer can only point to one function.&#160; .Net, on the other hand, supports multicast delegates – delegates that point to <em>multiple</em> functions.&#160; You can combine two existing delegates using the + operator (or by calling Delegate.Combine) to create a single new delegate instance that points two all of the methods in the original two delegates.&#160; This new delegate stores all of the methods from the original two delegates in a private array of delegates called InvocationList (the delegates in this array are ordinary non-multicast delegates that each only point to a single method).&#160; </p>  <p>Note that delegates, like strings, are immutable.&#160; Adding two delegates together creates a third delegate containing the methods from the first two; the original delegate instances are not affected.&#160; For example, writing <code>delegateField += SomeMethod</code> creates a new delegate instance containing the methods originally in <code>delegateField</code> as well as <code>SomeMethod</code>, then stores this new instance in <code>delegateField</code>.</p>  <p>Similarly, the - operator (or Delegate.Remove) will remove the second operand from the first one (again, returning a new delegate instance).&#160; If the second operand has multiple methods, all of them will be removed from the final delegate.&#160; If some of the methods in the second operand appear multiple times in the original delegate, only the last occurrence of each one will be removed (the one most recently added).&#160; The RemoveAll method will remove all occurrences.&#160; If all of the methods were removed, it will return null; there is no such thing as an empty delegate instance.</p>  <p>Multicast delegates are not intended to be used with delegates that return values.&#160; If you call a non-void delegate that contains multiple methods, it will return the return value of the last method in the delegate.&#160; If you want to see the return values of all of the methods, you’ll need to loop over GetInvocationList() and call each delegate individually.</p>  <p>Multicast delegates also don’t play well with the new covariant and contravariant generic delegates in .Net 4.0.&#160; You cannot combine two delegates unless their types match exactly, including variant generic parameters.</p>  <p>Function pointers cannot easily be combined the way multicast delegates can.&#160; The only way to combine function pointers without cooperation from the code that calls the pointer is to make a function that uses a closure to call all of the function pointers you want to call.</p>  <p>In Javascript, that would look like this:</p>

function combine() {
    var methods = arguments;

    return function() { 
        var retVal;
        for(var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) 
            retVal = methods[i].apply(this, arguments);
        return retVal;
    };
