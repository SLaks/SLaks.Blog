<p>.Net developers frequently need to build connection strings, especially when connecting to Access or Excel files using OleDB.    <br />Code like the following has been written countless times:</p>  <pre class="brush: csharp;">//Bad code! Do not use!
string conn = &quot;Data Source=&quot; + openFileDialog1.FileName + &quot;; &quot;
            + &quot;Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;&quot;
            + &quot;Extended Properties=\&quot;Excel 8.0\&quot;&quot;;</pre>

<p>This code looks innocuous at first glance, but will not work for all filenames.&#160; If the filename contains characters like <code>'</code>, <code>&quot;</code>, <code>;</code>, or <code>=</code>, this code will create an invalid connection string and throw an exception.</p>

<p>The correct way to build connection strings is to use one of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbconnectionstringbuilder.aspx">DbConnectionStringBuilder</a> classes.&#160; This class implements a dictionary of key-value pairs in the connection string.&#160; It has a <code>ConnectionString</code> property which assembles the instanceâ€™s contents into a usable connection string.&#160; Unlike the string concatenation shown above, this property will correctly escape all values.</p>

<p>In addition, each of the database clients included with the .Net framework (SQL, OleDB, ODBC, Oracle, and Entity Framework) have their own inherited ConnectionStringBuilder classes in their respective namespaces.&#160; These classes add type-safe properties for the the keys supported by their databases, and handle any special cases when generating the connection string.</p>

<p>Thus, the correct way to write the above code is:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">var connBuilder = new OleDbConnectionStringBuilder {
    DataSource = openFileDialog1.FileName,
    Provider = &quot;Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0&quot;
};
connBuilder[&quot;Extended Properties&quot;] = &quot;Excel 12.0 Macro&quot;;</pre>
As an added bonus, these classes implement ICustomTypeDescriptor, so they can be bound to a PropertyGrid to allow the end-user to edit the connection string.&#160; This can be seen in certain places in Visual Studio.
