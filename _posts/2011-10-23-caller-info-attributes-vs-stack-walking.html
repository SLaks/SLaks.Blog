<p>People sometimes wonder why C# 5 needs to add caller info attributes, when this information is already available by using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.stacktrace.aspx">StackTrace class</a>.&#160; In reality, caller info attributes behave rather differently from the StackTrace class, for a number of reasons.</p>  <h2>Advantages to Caller Info Attributes</h2>  <p>The primary reason to use caller info attributes is that they’re <em>much</em> faster.&#160; Stack walking is one of the slowest internal (as opposed to network IO) things you can do in .Net (disclaimer: I haven’t measured).&#160; By contrast, caller info attributes have exactly 0 performance penalty.&#160; Caller info is resolved at compile-time; the callsite is compiled to pass a string or int literal that was determined by the compiler.&#160; Incidentally, this is why C# 5 doesn’t have [CallerType] or [CallerMemberInfo] attributes; the compiler team wasn’t happy with the performance of the result IL and didn’t have time to implement proper caching to make it faster.</p>  <p>Caller info attributes are also more reliable than stack walking.&#160; Stack walking will give incorrect results if the JITter decides to inline either your method or its caller.&#160; Since caller info attributes are resolved at compile-time, they are immune to inlining.&#160; Also, stack walking can only give line number and filename info if the calling assembly’s PDB file is present at runtime, whereas [CallerFileName] and [CallerLineNumber] will always work.&#160; </p>  <p>Caller info attributes are also unaffected by compiler transformations.&#160; If you do a stack walk from inside a lambda expression, iterator, or async method, you’ll see the compiler-generated method; there is no good way to retrieve the name of the original method.&#160; Since caller info attributes are processed by the compiler, [CallerMemberName] should correctly pass the name of the containing method (although I cannot verify this).&#160; Note that stack walking will retrieve the correct line number even inside lambda expressions (assuming there is a PDB file)</p>  <h2>Advantages To Stack Walking</h2>  <p>There are still a couple of reasons to use the StackTrace class.&#160; Obviously, if you want to see more than one frame (if you want your caller’s caller), you need to use StackTrace.&#160; Also, if you want to support clients in languages that don’t feature caller info attributes, such as C# 4 or F#, you should walk the stack instead.</p>  <p>Stack walking is the only way to find the caller’s type or assembly (or a MemberInfo object), since caller info attributes do not provide this information.</p>  <p>Stack walking is also the only choice for security-related scenarios.&#160; It should be obvious that caller info attributes can <em>trivially</em> be spoofed; nothing prevents the caller from passing arbitrary values as the optional parameter.&#160; Stack walking, by contrast, happens within the CLR and cannot be spoofed.&#160; </p>  <p>Note that there are some other concerns with stack walking for security purposes. </p>  <ul>   <li>Filename and line number information can be spoofed by providing a modified PDB file</li>    <li>Class and function names are meaningless; your enemy can name his function whatever he wants to.&#160; All you should rely on is the assembly name.</li>    <li>There are various ways for an attacker to cause your code to be called indirectly (eg, DynamicInvoking a delegate) so that his assembly isn’t the direct caller.&#160; In fact, if the attacker invokes your delegate on a UI thread (by calling BeginInvoke), his assembly won’t show up on the callstack at all.&#160; The attacker can also compile a dynamic assembly that calls your function and call into that assembly.</li>    <li>As always, beware of inlining</li> </ul>
