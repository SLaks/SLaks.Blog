<p>Have you ever written code like this:</p>  <pre class="brush: csharp;">public void UpdateLayout(bool doFullLayout) {
    //Code
    if (doFullLayout) {
        //Expensive code
    }
    //More code
}</pre>

<p>This pattern is commonly used when some operation has a “cheap” mode and an “expensive” mode.&#160; Other code will have calls like <code>UpdateLayout(false)</code> and <code>UpdateLayout(true)</code> scattered throughout.</p>

<p>The problem is that this isn’t very obvious for people who aren’t familiar with the codebase.&#160; If you take a look at a file you’ve never seen before and see calls like <code>UpdateLayout(false)</code> and <code>UpdateLayout(true)</code> scattered, you’ll have no idea what the true / false means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The simplest solution is to break it out into two methods: <code>UpdateComplexLayout()</code> and <code>UpdateBasicLayout()</code>.&#160; However,&#160; if the two different layout modes have intertwined code paths (eg, the code before and after the <code>if</code> above), this either won’t be possible or will lead to ugly duplication of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One alternative is to use enums: </p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">public enum LayoutUpdateType {
    Basic,
    Full
}

public void UpdateLayout(LayoutUpdateType type) {
    //Code
    if (type == LayoutUpdateType.Full) {
        //Expensive code
    }
    //More code
}</pre>

<p>This way, the callsites are much more descriptive: <code>UpdateLayout(LayoutUpdateType.Full)</code>.&#160; This also makes it easy to add more update modes in the future should the need arise.&#160; However, it makes the callsites much more verbose.&#160; When used frequently, this pattern can lead a vast proliferation of enum types that are each only used by one method, polluting the namespace and making more important enums harder to notice.</p>
