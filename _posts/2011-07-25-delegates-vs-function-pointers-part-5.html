<p><i>This is part 5 in a series about state and function pointers; part 1 is <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html">here</a>.</i></p>  <p><a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-4-c.html">Last time</a>, we saw how C# 2 supports closures by compiling anonymous functions into member functions of a special class that holds local state from the outer function.&#160; </p>  <p>Unlike the languages we’ve looked at before, Javascript has had closures baked in to the languages since its inception.&#160; My <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html#example">standard example</a> can be achieved very simply in Javascript:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight js %}
var x = 2;
var numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
var hugeNumbers = numbers.filter(function(n) { return n > x; });
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This code uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter"><code>Array.filter</code> method</a>, new to Javascript 1.6, to create a new array with those elements from the first array that pass a callback.&#160; The function expression passed to <code>filter</code> captures the <code>x</code> variable for use inside the callback.</p>

<p>This looks extremely similar to the C# 2.0 version from last time.&#160; However. under the covers, it’s rather different.</p>

<p>Like .Net managed instance methods, all Javascript functions take a hidden <code>this</code> parameter.&#160; However, unlike .Net, Javascript does not have delegates.&#160; There is no (intrinsic) way to bind an object to the <code>this</code> parameter the way a .Net closed delegate does.&#160; Instead, the <code>this</code> parameter comes from the callsite, depending on how the function was called.&#160; Therefore, we cannot pass state in the <code>this</code> parameter the way we did in C#.</p>

<p>Instead, all Javascript function expressions capture the variable environment of the scope that they are declared in as a hidden property of the function.&#160; Therefore, a function can reference local variables from its declaring scope.&#160; Unlike C#, which binds functions to their parent scopes using a field in a separate delegate object that points to the function, Javascript functions have their parent scopes baked in to the functions themselves.&#160; </p>

<p>Javascript doesn’t have separate delegate objects that can hold a function and a <code>this</code> parameter.&#160; Instead, the value of the <code>this</code> parameter is determined at the call-site, depending on how the function was called.&#160; This is a common source of confusion to inexperienced Javascript developers.</p>

<p>To simulate closed delegates, we can make a method that takes a function as well as a target object to call it on, and returns a new function which calls the original function with <code>this</code> equal to the target parameter.&#160; That sounds overwhelmingly complicated, but it’s actually not that hard:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight js %}
function createDelegate(func, target) {
    return function() { 
        return func.apply(target, arguments);
    };
}

var myObject = { name: "Target!"};
function myMethod() {
    return this.name;
}

var delegate = createDelegate(myMethod, myObject);
alert(delegate());
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This <code>createDelegate</code> method returns a function expression that captures the <code>func</code> and <code>target</code> parameters, and calls <code>func</code> in the context of <code>target</code>.&#160; Instead of storing the target in a property of a <code>Delegate</code> object (like .Net does), this code stores it in the inner function expression’s closure.</p>

<p>Javascript 1.8.5 provides the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind"><code>Function.bind</code> method</a>, which is equivalent to this <code>createDelegate</code> method, with additional capabilities as well.&#160; In Chrome, Firefox 4, and IE9, you can write</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight js %}
var myObject = { name: "Target!"};
function myMethod() {
    return this.name;
}

var delegate = myMethod.bind(myObject);
alert(delegate());
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
