<p>Razor involves two distinct components: The Razor engine and the WebPages framework.</p>  <p>The Razor engine, in System.Web.Razor.dll, parses CSHTML (and VBHTML) files into CodeDOM trees.&#160; Except for the word Web in project name, the engine has nothing to do with ASP.Net; it doesn’t even reference System.Web.dll.&#160; In fact, it targets the .Net Client Profile, and only references mscorlib and System.dll.</p>  <p>The Razor engine is aware of all of Razor’s syntax-level features (code nuggets, sections, helpers), but is not aware of what they mean; it blindly transforms them into function calls.</p>  <p>The Razor engine can be used without ASP.Net for any kind of templating system.&#160; This is done by inheriting the RazorEngineHost class to provide default code-generation settings (such as base class and method name), then passing the host to a RazorTemplateParser.&#160; </p>  <p>The standard syntax will be annoying when generating non-XML-like content.&#160; To avoid this, one can write a custom MarkupParser to define a Razor syntax for a different markup language (such as CSS). </p>  <hr />The WebPages framework, in System.Web.Webpages.dll, is a set of classes to use with the Razor parser.&#160; It contains the WebPage class which standard Razor pages inherit. This class defines the methods which are blindly called by the Razor parser, such as DefineSection and WriteLiteral.&#160;&#160;&#160; This framework also handles _PageStart and _AppStart pages and contains the HtmlHelper infrastructure.    <p>The WebPages framework is not directly connected to the Razor parser.&#160; It could theoretically be used with a different template engine, as long as the template engine emits the correct method calls and class definitions.&#160; (more on this later)</p>  <p>The WebPages framework also contains two sets of utility methods.&#160; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.helpers.aspx">System.Web.Helpers</a>.dll contains miscellaneous utility classes, such as Crypto and WebMail wrappers, plus grid and chart implementations.&#160; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.web.helpers.aspx">Microsoft.Web.Helpers</a>.dll contains HTML helper classes which integrate with various third-party services, including Twitter, ReCaptcha, Google Analytics, and more.&#160; Most of these helpers can also be used in ordinary ASPX pages.</p>  <p>The source code for all of these projects is available <a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/58781">here</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/02/dissecting-razor-part-2-gluing-pieces.html"><em>Next time</em>: Gluing it all together</a>.</p>
