After nearly a year of inactivity, I have finally returned to my blog.

I had neglected it for so long primarily because I don't like Blogger's compose options.  After spending so much time on StackOverflow and GitHub, I find Markdown far more convenient than Windows Live Writer or Blogger's compose window, especially when writing about code.  I also was never very happy with the design I originally created, and doing raw HTML / CSS design in Blogger is painful.

To solve these problems, I just finished porting my blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  Now that I can write posts in my [favorite Markdown editor](http://vswebessentials.com/), I hope to end up writing much more.

In the next few posts, I'll write about how I designed the new blog and how I migrated my existing content.


My old blog is still up at [old-blog.slaks.net](http://old-blog.slaks.net).  However, all of the content has been migrated to the new one (with the same URLs), so that should not be necessary.  If you see anything wrong with the new site, let me know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Schabse) or [by email](mailto:Blog@SLaks.net?subject=Blog+Migration+Problem).
