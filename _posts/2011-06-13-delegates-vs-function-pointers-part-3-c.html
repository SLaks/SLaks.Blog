<p><i>This is part 3 in a series about state and function pointers; part 1 is <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html">here</a>.</i> </p>  <p><a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-2-c.html">Last time</a>, we saw that it is impossible to bundle context along with a function pointer in C.</p>  <p>In C#, it is possible to fully achieve my <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html#example">standard example</a>.&#160; In order to explain how this works behind the scenes, I will limit this post to C# 1.0 and not use a lambda expression.&#160; This also means no LINQ, generics, or extension methods, so I will, once again, need to write the filter method myself. </p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
delegate bool IntFilter(int num);

static ArrayList Filter(IEnumerable source, IntFilter filter) {
    ArrayList retVal = new ArrayList();

    foreach(int i in source)
        if (filter(i))
            retVal.Add(i);
            
    return retVal;
}

class GreaterThan {
    public GreaterThan(int b) {
        this.bound = b;
    }
    int bound;
    public bool Passes(int num) {
        return num > bound;
    }
}

int x = 2;
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
Filter(numbers, new IntFilter(new GreaterThan(x).Passes));
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Please excuse the ugly code; in order to be true to C# 1.0, I can’t just write an iterator, and I can’t implicitly create the delegate.</p>

<p>This code creates a class called <code>GreaterThan</code> that holds the <code>Passes</code> method and the state used by the method.&#160; I create a delegate to pass to <code>Filter</code> out of the <code>Passes</code> method for an instance of the <code>GreaterThan</code> class from the local variable.</p>

<p>To understand how this works, we need to delve further into delegates.&#160; .Net delegates are more than just type-safe function pointers. Unlike the function pointers we've <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-2-c.html">looked at</a>, delegates include state – the <code>Target</code> property. This property stores the object to pass as the hidden <code>this</code> parameter to the method (It's actually somewhat more complicated than that; I will describe open and closed delegates at a later date).&#160; My example creates a delegate instance in which the <code>Target</code> property points to the <code>GreaterThan</code> instance.&#160; When I call the delegate, the <code>Passes</code> method is called on the correct instance from the <code>Target</code> property, so it can read the <code>bound</code> field.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-4-c.html">Next time</a>, we'll see how the C# 2.0+ compilers generate all this boilerplate for you using anonymous methods and lambda expressions.
