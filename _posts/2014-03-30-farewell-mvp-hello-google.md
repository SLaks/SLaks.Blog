After four exciting years, I am regretfully leaving the [Microsoft MVP program](https://mvp.microsoft.com/).  I have greatly enjoyed meeting and interacting with the Roslyn team, as well as the other C# & VB MVPs, and I hope to be able to keep up these connections at technical conferences.  I've also savored the unique opportunity to discuss the future of C# and Visual Studio with the development teams at Microsoft, especially as new versions of these products are developed (I've filed over 150 bugs through the program).

In brighter news, I'm proud to announce that I've been hired by Google, working within the Google Docs team in the [NYC office](https://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/new-york/).  Working for Google involves a wonderful corporate culture and a fantastic suite of internal tools, and I'm excited to contribute to Google's products and improve the web for everyone.

Since Google and Microsoft are direct competitors, it [is not possible](https://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/10/01/mvp-no-more.aspx) to maintain both positions.  Nevertheless, I hope to continue contributing to the C# community on StackOverflow, and to continue my open-source work on [Visual](https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013) [Studio](https://github.com/SLaks/Ref12) [extensions](https://github.com/SLaks/Rebracer) (depending on how much spare time I have).

Keep coding!
