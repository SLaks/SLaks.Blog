<p><em>This is part 2 in a series about state and function pointers; part 1 is <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html">here</a>.</em></p>  <p>Unlike most other languages, it is not possible to include any form of state in a function pointer in C.&#160; Therefore, it is impossible to fully implement closures in C without the cooperation of the call-site and/or the compiler.</p>  <p>To illustrate what this means in practice, I will refer to my <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html#example">standard example</a>, using a filter function to find all elements in an array that are greater than <code>x</code>.&#160; Since C doesn’t have any such function, I’ll write one myself, inspired by <code>qsort</code>:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight cpp %}
void* filter(void* base, 
             size_t count, 
             size_t elemSize, 
             int (*predicate)(const void *)) {
    //Magic...
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>With this function, one can easily find all elements that are greater than some constant:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight cpp %}
int predicate(const void* item) {
        return *(int*)item > 2;
}

int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
filter(arr, 4, sizeof(int), &predicate);
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>However, if we want to replace the hard-coded <code>2</code> with a local variable, it becomes more complicated.&#160; Since function pointers, unlike delegates, do not have state, there is no simple way to pass the local variable to the function.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4210689/pass-extra-parameter-to-comparator-for-qsort/4210705#4210705">most obvious answer</a> is to use a global variable:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight cpp %}
static int minimum;
int predicate(const void* item) {
        return *(int*)item > minimum;
}

int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
minimum = x;
filter(arr, 4, sizeof(int), &predicate);
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>However, this code will fail horribly if it’s ever run on multiple threads.&#160; In simple cases, you can work around that by storing the value in a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread-local variable</a> (or in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682661.aspx">fiber-local storage</a> for code that uses fibers).&#160;&#160; Because each thread will have its own global, the threads won’t conflict with each-other.&#160; Obviously, this won’t work if the callback might be run on a different thread.</p>

<p>However, even if everything is running on one thread, this still isn’t enough if the code can be re-entrant, or if the callback might be called after the original function call finishes.&#160; This technique assumes that exactly one callback (from a single call to the function that accepted the callback) will be used at any given time.&#160; If the callback might be invoked later (eg, a timer, or a UI handler), this method will break down, since all of the callbacks will share the same global.</p>

<p>In these more complicated cases, one can only pass any state with the cooperation of the original function.&#160; In this (overly simple) example, the <code>filter</code> method can be modified to take a <code>context</code> parameter and pass it to the predicate:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight cpp %}
void* filter(void* base, 
             size_t count,
             size_t elemSize, 
             int (*predicate)(const void *, const void *), 
             const void* context) {
        //More magic...
}
int predicate(const void* item, const void* context) {
        return *(int*)item > *(int*)context;
}

int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
filter(arr, 4, sizeof(int), &predicate, &x);
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>To pass around more complicated state, one could pass a pointer to a <code>struct</code> as the <code>context</code>.</p>
