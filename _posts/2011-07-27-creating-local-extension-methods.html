<p>Sometimes, it can be useful to make an extension method specifically for a single block of code.&#160; Unfortunately, since extension methods cannot appear in nested classes, there is no obvious way to do that.</p>  <p>Instead, you can create a child namespace containing the extension method.&#160; In order to limit the extension methodâ€™s visibility to a single method, you can put that method in a separate namespace block.&#160; This way, you can add a <code>using</code> statement to that namespace alone.</p>  <p>For example:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
namespace Company.Project {
    partial class MyClass {
        ...
    }
}
namespace Company.Project {
    using MyClassExtensions;
    namespace MyClassExtensions {
        static class Extensions {
            public static string Name<T>(this T obj) {
                if (default(T) == null && Equals(obj, default(T)))
                    return "(null " + typeof(T) + ")";
                return obj.GetType() + ": " + obj.ToString() 
                     + "{declared as " + typeof(T) + "}";
            }
        }
    }
    partial class MyClass {
        void DoSomething() {
            object x = new DateTime();
            string name = x.Name();
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>Since the <code>using MyClassExtensions</code> statement appears inside the second namespace block, the extension methods are only visible within that block.&#160; Code that uses these extension method can appear in this second block, while the rest of the class can go in the original namespace block without the extension methods.</p>

<p>This technique should be avoided where possible, since it leads to confusing and non-obvious code.&#160; However, there are situations in which this can make some code much more readable.</p>
