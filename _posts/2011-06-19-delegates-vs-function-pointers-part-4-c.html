<p><i>This is part 4 in a series about state and function pointers; part 1 is <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html">here</a>.</i> </p>  <p><a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-3-c.html">Last time</a>, we saw that it is possible to pass local state with a delegate in C#.&#160; However, it involves lots of repetitive single-use classes, leading to ugly code.</p>  <p>To alleviate this tedious task, C# 2 supports <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0yw3tz5k%28v=VS.100%29.aspx">anonymous methods</a>, which allow you to embed a function inside another function.&#160; This makes my <a href="/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-1.html#example">standard example</a> much simpler:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
//C# 2.0
int x = 2;
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

int[] hugeNumbers = Array.FindAll(
    numbers, 
    delegate(int n) { return n > x; }
);



//C# 3.0
int x = 2;
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

IEnumerable<int> hugeNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n > x);
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>Clearly, this is much simpler than the C# 1.0 version from last time.&#160; However, anonymous methods and lambda expressions are compile-time features; the CLR itself is not aware of them.&#160; How does this code work? How can an anonymous method use a local variable from its parent scope?</p>

<p>This is an example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29">closure</a> – a function bundled together with external variables that the function uses.&#160; The C# compiler handles this the same way that I did manually last time in C# 1: it generates a class to hold the function and the variables that it uses, then creates a delegate from the member function in the class.&#160; Thus, the local state is passed as the delegate’s <code>this</code> parameter.</p>

<p>To see how the C# compiler implements closures, I’ll use <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ILSpy.ashx">ILSpy</a> to decompile the more-familiar C# 3 version: (I simplified the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/6402491/34397">compiler-generated names</a> for readability)</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class ClosureClass {
    public int x;
    public bool Lambda(int n) {
        return n > this.x;
    }
}
private static void Main() {
    ClosureClass closure = new ClosureClass();
    closure.x = 2;
    int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    IEnumerable<int> hugeNumbers = numbers.Where(closure.Lambda);
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>The <code>ClosureClass</code> (which was actually named <code>&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass1</code>) is equivalent to the <code>GreaterThan</code> class from my previous example.&#160; It holds the local variables used in the lambda expression.&#160; Note that this class <em>replaces</em> the variables – in the original method, instead a local variable named <code>x</code>, the compiler uses the public <code>x</code> field from the <code>ClosureClass</code>.&#160; This means that any changes to the variable affect the lambda expression as well.</p>

<p>The lambda expression is compiled into the <code>Lambda</code> method (which was originally named <code>&lt;Main&gt;b__0</code>).&#160; It uses the same field to access the local variable, sharing state between the original outer function and its lambda expression.</p>
