<p>One common question about ASP.Net MVC is how to make “default” controller.</p>  <p>Most websites will have a <code>Home</code> controller with actions like <code>About</code>, <code>FAQ</code>, <code>Privacy</code>, or similar pages.&#160; Ordinarily, these actions can only be accessed through URLs like <code>~/Home/About</code>.&#160; Most people would prefer to put these URLs directly off the root: <code>~/About</code>, etc.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to do that in ASP.Net MVC without making a separate route or controller for each action.</p>  <p>You cannot simply create a route matching <code>&quot;/{action}&quot;</code> and map it to the <code>Home</code> controller, since such a route would match any URL with exactly one term, including URLs meant for other controllers.&#160; Since the routing engine is not aware of MVC actions, it doesn’t know that this route should only match actions that actually exist on the controller.</p>  <p>To make it work, we can add a <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2008/08/07/asp-net-mvc-tip-30-create-custom-route-constraints.aspx">custom route constraint</a> that forces this route to only match URLs that correspond to actual methods on the controller.</p>  <p>To this end, I wrote an extension method that scans a controller for all action methods and adds a route that matches actions in that controller. The code is available at <a title="https://gist.github.com/1225676" href="https://gist.github.com/1225676">gist.github.com/1225676</a>.&#160; It can be used like this:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
routes.MapDefaultController<Controllers.HomeController>();
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This maps the route <code>&quot;/{action}/{id}&quot;</code> (with <code>id</code> optional) to all actions defined in <code>HomeController</code>.&#160;&#160; Note that this code ignores custom <code>ActionNameSelectorAttribute</code>s. (The built-in <code>[ActionName(…)]</code> <strong>is </strong>supported)</p>

<p>For additional flexibility, you can also create custom routes that will only match actions in a specific controller.&#160; This is useful if you have a single controller with a number of actions that has special route requirements that differ from the rest of your site.</p>

<p>For example: </p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
routes.MapControllerActions<UsersController>(
    name: "User routes",
    url:  "{userName}/{action}"
    defaults: new { action = "Index" }
);
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>(Note that this example will also match URLs intended for other controllers with the same actions; plan your routes carefully)</p>
