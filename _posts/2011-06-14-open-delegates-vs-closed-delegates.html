<p>.Net supports two kinds of delegates: Open delegates and closed delegates. </p>  <p>When you create a delegate that points to an instance method, the instance that you created it from is stored in the delegate’s <code>Target</code> property.&#160; This property is passed as the first parameter to the method that the delegate points to.&#160; For instance methods, this is the implicit this parameter; for static methods, it's the method's first parameter.&#160; These are called <i>closed </i>delegates, because they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29">close over</a> the first parameter and bring it into the delegate instance. </p>  <p>It is also possible to create <i>open</i> delegates which do not pass a first parameter.&#160; Open delegates do not use the <code>Target</code> property; instead, all of the target method’s parameters are passed from the delegate’s formal parameter list, including the first parameter.&#160; Therefore, an open delegate pointing to a given method must have one parameter more than a closed delegate pointing to the same method.&#160; Open delegates are usually used to point to static methods.&#160; When you make a delegate pointing to a static method, you (generally) don't want the delegate to hold a first parameter for the method.&#160; </p>  <p>In addition to these two normal cases, it is also possible (in .Net 2.0 and later) to create open delegates for instance methods and to create closed delegates for static methods.&#160; With one exception, C# doesn’t have any syntactical support for these unusual delegates, so they can only be created by calling the <code>CreateDelegate</code> method. </p>  <p>Open delegates by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53cz7sc6.aspx"><code>CreateDelegate</code> overload</a> that doesn’t take a <code>target</code> parameter.&#160; Before .Net 2.0, this function could only be called with a static method.&#160;&#160; In .Net 2.0, you can call this function with an instance method to create an open delegate.&#160; Such a delegate will call use its first parameter as <code>this</code> instead of its <code>Target</code> field.&#160;</p>  <p>As a concrete example, consider the <code>String.ToUpperInvariant()</code> method.&#160; Ordinarily, this method takes no parameters, and operates on the string it’s called on.&#160; An open delegate pointing to this instance method would take a single string parameter, and call the method on that parameter.</p>  <p>For example:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
Func<string> closed = new Func<string>("a".ToUpperInvariant);
Func<string, string> open = (Func<string, string>)
    Delegate.CreateDelegate(
        typeof(Func<string, string>),
        typeof(string).GetMethod("ToUpperInvariant")
    );

closed();     //Returns "A"
open("abc");  //Returns "ABC"
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>Closed delegates are created by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/74x8f551.aspx"><code>CreateDelegate</code> overload</a> that takes a <code>target</code> parameter.&#160; In .Net 2.0, this can be called with a static method and an instance of that method’s first argument type to create a closed delegate that calls the method with the given <code>target</code> as its first parameter.&#160; Closed delegates <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/06/25/mmm-curry.aspx">curry</a> the first parameter from the target method.&#160; For example:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
Func<object, bool> deepThought = (Func<object, bool>)
    Delegate.CreateDelegate(
        typeof(Func<object, bool>),
        2,
        typeof(object).GetMethod("Equals", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public)
    );
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This code curries the static Object.Equals method to create a delegate that calls <code>Equals</code> with 2 and the delegate’s single parameter).&#160; It’s equivalent to <code>x =&gt; Object.Equals(2, x)</code>.&#160; Note that since the method is (generally) not a member of the target object’s type, we need to pass an actual <code>MethodInfo</code> instance; a name alone isn’t good enough.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot create a closed delegate from a static method whose first parameter is a value type, because, unlike all instance methods, static delegates that take value types receive their parameters by value, not as a reference.&#160;&#160; For more details, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1016033/34397">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sreekarc/archive/2009/06/25/why-can-t-extension-methods-on-value-type-be-curried.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>C# 3 added limited syntactical support for creating closed delegates.&#160; You can create a delegate from an extension method as if it were an instance method on the type it extends.&#160; For example:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
var allNumbers = Enumerable.Range(1, Int32.MaxValue);
Func<int, IEnumerable<int>> countTo = allNumbers.Take;
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This code creates an <code>IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;</code> containing all positive integers, then creates a closed delegate that curries this sequence into the static <code>Enumerable.Take&lt;T&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)</code> method. </p>

<p>Except for extension methods, open instance delegates and closed static delegates are rarely used in actual code.&#160; However, it is important to understand how ordinary open and closed delegates work, and where the target object ends up for instance delegates.</p>
