<p>Most languages – with the unfortunate exception of Java – allow functions to be passed around as variables.&#160; C has function pointers, .Net has delegates, and Javascript and most functional programming languages treat functions as first class objects.</p>  <p>There is a fundamental difference between C-style function pointers vs. delegates or function objects.&#160; Pure function pointers cannot hold any state other than the function itself.&#160; In contrast, delegates and function objects do store additional state that the function can use.</p>  <p id="example">To illustrate this difference,&#160; I will use a simple example.&#160; Most programming environments have a filter function that takes a collection and a predicate (a function that takes an item from the collection and returns a boolean), and returns a new collection with those items from the original collection that match the predicate.&#160; In C#, this is the LINQ <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb534803.aspx">Where method</a>; in Javascript, it’s the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter">Array.filter method</a> (introduced by Javascript 1.6).</p>  <p>Given a list of numbers, you can use such a method to find all numbers in the list that are greater than a local variable <code>x</code>.&#160; However, in order to do that, the predicate have access to <code>x</code>.&#160; In <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-2-c.html">subsequent</a> <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/06/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-3-c.html">posts</a>, I’ll explore how this can be done in <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2011/07/delegates-vs-function-pointers-part-5.html">different</a> languages.</p>
