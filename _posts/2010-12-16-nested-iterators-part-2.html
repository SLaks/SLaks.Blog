<p>In <a href="http://blog.slaks.net/2010/12/nested-iterators-part-1.html">part 1</a>, we discussed the simple approach to making a nested iterator.&#160; However, we fell short of a completely lazy nested iterator.</p>  <p>In simple cases, we can make an separate iterator method for the subsequence: </p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<IEnumerable<int>> FullyLazy() {
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        yield return Inner(i);
}
IEnumerable<int> Inner(int i) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
        yield return i * 10 + j;
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
Note that this is actually smaller than the single-method implementation! 

<p>This seems to work very well; the inner iterator code for a particular subsequence will not execute at all unless that subsequence is actually enumerated.</p>

<p>However, this approach falls short in practice.&#160; To see why, consider a real-world example. 
  <br />Here is a fully lazy implementation of a Partition method, which converts a sequence into a 2D “jagged IEnumerable” where each subsequence (partition) contains <em>n</em> elements.</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
class Ref<T> { 
    public Ref(T value) { Value = value; } 
    public T Value { get; set; } 
}

public static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> Partition<T>
              (this IEnumerable<T> sequence, int size) {
    using(var enumerator = sequence.GetEnumerator()) {
        var isFinished = new Ref<bool>(false);
        while(!isFinished.Value) {
            yield return PartitionInner(
                 enumerator, size, isFinished
            );
        }
    }
}
static IEnumerable<T> PartitionInner<T>
      (IEnumerator<T> enumerator, int size, Ref<bool> isFinished) {
    while(size --> 0) {
          isFinished.Value = !enumerator.MoveNext();
        if (isFinished.Value) yield break;
        yield return enumerator.Current;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>This method is complicated by the need to communicate back from the inner iterator to the outer one.&#160; Since <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/05/04/the-stack-is-an-implementation-detail-part-two.aspx">iterators cannot have <code>ref</code> parameters</a>, I need to make a “box” class that holds a reference to an int.&#160; This allows the outer iterator to find out when the sequence finishes.</p>

<p>In addition, this implementation has a subtle bug: If the last partition is full, it will return an extra, empty, partition after it. 
  <br />Fixing this issue would require that the outer method call MoveNext() before each call to the inner method.&#160; This makes the code even more complicated; I won’t list it here (unless people really want me to)</p>

<p>This design has a more fundamental problem: The behavior of the outer method is determined by the inner ones.&#160; It will only work if each inner IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is enumerated exactly once, before the next MoveNext() call to the outer iterator.&#160; If, for example, you iterate each inner iterator twice, it will behave unexpectedly:</p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
Enumerable.Range(1, 8)
          .Partition(3)
          .Select(p => String.Join(", ", p.Concat(p)));
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
This code is intended to create strings that contain each partition twice.&#160; It is supposed to return 

<pre>1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6
7, 8, 7, 8</pre>

<p>However, it actually creates the strings</p>

<pre>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
7, 8</pre>

<p>Enumerating the inner iterator a second time will end up consuming extra items from the original sequence.</p>

<p>Thus, in order to produce enumerables that behave correctly, the inner enumerator <em>needs</em> to cache its items; it is impossible to make a fully lazy Partition method.</p>

<p>It gets worse.&#160; In order to allow callers to write <code>thingy.Partition(5).Skip(2)</code>, (which should skip the first two partitions) the <em>outer</em> enumerator needs to cache all items, because it cannot assume that the inner iterators will be called at all.&#160; </p>

<p>Thus, the laziest possible Partition method must use the <a title="Part 1" href="http://blog.slaks.net/2010/12/nested-iterators-part-1.html">original approach</a>: </p>
{% endraw %}
{% highlight csharp %}
public static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> PartitionCorrect<T>
              (this IEnumerable<T> sequence, int size) {
    List<T> partition = new List<T>();
    foreach(var item in sequence) {
        partition.Add(item);
        if (partition.Count == size) {
            yield return partition;
            partition = new List<T>();
        }
    }
    if (partition.Count > 0)
        yield return partition;
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% raw %}
<p>It would be possible to write a slightly lazier version that combines these two approaches and passes a List&lt;T&gt; to the inner iterator, which would return whatever is in the list, then enumerate if necessary to fill the list. However, I’m too <em>lazy</em> to do it.&#160; (unless people really want me to)</p>
