Visual Studio includes a world-class Javascript editor with an excellent IntelliSense editor.  

# Getting Started
First, [download](http://nodejs.org) and install Node.js.

Once Node.js installed, open a Node.js command prompt, cd to the folder you wnat to make a project in, and run `npm init` to create an initial `package.json` for your Node.js project.  This file specifies basic information about your code, including dependencies to install from npm, license information, and the command to run or include (for reusable modules) the code.

# Web Essentials Features
`require()` IntelliSense & go-to-definition.
